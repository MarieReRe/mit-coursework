Hello classmates, great to virtually meet you. I am very new to cloud & devops technologies and the tech industry in general. I started my tech journey just over two years transitioning from my career as a chef. I am now at my second startup; Harness. Harness is a software delivery lifecycle platform best known for its continuous delivery solution but we have many products from our open source continuous delivery product Drone and chaos engineering product to feature flags and cloud cost management.  I lead our FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) community. I am the only one in this role currently and I am in charge of our FOSS user's success. This entail somewhat marketing-esque tasks such as nuture emails, coordinating with each of our products engineers to answer community questions, updating documentation for usability, as well as having our users set up 1:1 time with me to personally set them up; whether that be assisting in their Kubernetes clusters or troubleshooting delegate installation. 

I am currently using acloudguru to get up to speed on container and container orchestration and I am assessing which cloud to get certified in. 



How do we use the cloud? 
I actually was not sure how Harness currently uses the the cloud from the technical or business side so I spoke with our Senior Manager of Engineering Operations. We currently are using one cloud instead of multicloud with no on-prem. We also have different accounts for DEV, QA, Prod...etc and we have other cloud providers to test in. To manage our Cloud spend we use our own Harness product to gain insight into spend, budgeting and forcasting.

We also have lots of resources on CCM (Cloud Cost Management): https://university.harness.io/path/ngccm
